\section{Installing the Board}
	%
	\balance
	%
The \deviceName\ board can be installed in any PCIe-CEM slot wiht x1 or more lanes. 
Make sure the PC is powered off and the main power connector is disconnected while installing the board.\par

\section{\deviceName\ Inputs and Connectors}
	\subsection{Connectors}
	%
	The inputs of the \deviceName\ are located on the slot bracket. Figure \ref{fig:schematics} on page \pageref{fig:schematics} shows the location of the start input S and the four stop inputs A to D.

	Lemo-00 connectors are used for input connection. The inputs are AC-coupled and have an impedance of 50$\Omega$. 
	A schematic of the input circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:inputcirc} on page \pageref{fig:inputcirc}. 
	The digital threshold for any input can be adjusted in order to comply with a manifold of single ended signaling standards.
	The threshold can also be used to configure the input for either positive or negative pulses.
	
	The active termination can be used to generate DC-coupled output pulses for automatic internal triggering and control of external devices using the TiGer timing pattern generator.

	Furthermore, three inter board connectors can be found at the top edge of the \deviceName\ board, as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:schematics} on page \pageref{fig:schematics}. 
	Connector C1 (labelled J25 on the board) is reserved for future use. The pinout of connector C2 (labelled J12 on the board) is shown in Table \ref{con2} and the pinout of connector C3 (labelled as J6 on the board) is depicted in Table \ref{con3}.

\section{\deviceName\ Functionality}
	The \deviceName\ is a ``classic'' common start time-to-digital converter. 
	It records the time difference between a leading or trailing edge on the start input to the leading and trailing edges of the stop inputs. 
	Rising and falling edges of the stop channel A-D can be enabled individually. The measurements are quantized to $500$~ps for -2G devices and tp $1000$~ps for -1G devices. 
	The timestamps are recorded in integer multiples of a bin size of $500$~ps for both board types to simplifiy setups where data from differnt board types is combined.
	Transitions of the input signals are called hits. To reliably detect hits the signal has to be stable for more than one quantisation interval before and after the edge.  
	Triggers on the start channel must not occur less than 5ns apart. The \deviceName\ records events without dead time at a readout rate of about 48MHits/s.

	\subsection{Grouping and Events}
	In typical applications a start hit is followed by a manifold of hits on e.g. a detector. 
	The hits recorded are managed in groups (which are called ``events'' in some applications). 
	Figure \ref{fig:grouping} shows a corresponding timing diagram. The user can define the range of a group, i.e. the time window within which hits 
	on the stop channels are recorded, in software. Hits occurring outside of that time window are discarded. 
	The maximum recording range for a group is $8.4~$ms. Different ranges can be set for each of the 4 stop channels by setting corresponding timetagger4\tu configuration.channel[n].start and .stop values in the channel configuration. 
	The values need to be set as multiples of $500$~ps.

	\subsection{Auto Triggering Function Generator\label{cp:AutoTriggeringFunctionGenerator}}
		Some applications require internal periodic or random triggering. The \deviceName\ function generator provides this functionality.\par

		The delay between two trigger pulses of this trigger generator is the sum of two components: A fixed value M and a pseudo random value given by the exponent N. \par

		The period is

		\begin{align}
			T = 1 + M + [1...2^N]
		\end{align}

		clock cycles with a duration of $4 ns$ per cycle.\par
		
		The trigger can be used as a source for the TiGer unit (see Section \ref{cp:tiger}).
	
	
	\subsection{Timing Generator (TiGer)\label{cp:tiger}}
		Each LEMO-00 input can be used as a LVCMOS trigger output. The TiGer function can be configured independently for each LEMO-00 connector. 
		Each TiGet block can use an arbitrary combination of inputs to trigger its state machine including the AutoTrigger.
		See Section \ref{cp:tigerblock} for a full description of the configuration options.

		%
		\begin{figure*}[ht]
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/xTDC4_tiger_matrix.pdf}
				\caption{TiGer blocks can generate outputs that are also available on inputs.\label{fig:matrix}}
			\end{center}
		\end{figure*}
		%

		Figure \ref{fig:matrix} shows how the TiGer blocks are connected. They can be triggered by an OR of an arbitrary combination of inputs, 
		including the auto trigger. Each TiGer can drive its output to its corresponding LEMO connector. This turns the connector into a DC coupled output. 
		Connected hardware must not drive any signals to connectors used as outputs, as doing so could damage both the \deviceName and the external hardware.
		Pulses that are short enough for the input AC coupling are available as input signals to the TimeTagger. 
		This can be used to measure exact time differences between the generated output signals and input signals on other channels.

		
		\subsubsection{TiGer Example: Generate 200 kHz Start Pulse}
		The AutoTrigger is used to generate a 200 kHz period. The TiGer generates a 200 kHz signal with $12 ns$ pulse width on LEMO-00 output Start.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb]
// generate an internal 200 kHz trigger
config.auto_trigger_period = 1250;
config.auto_trigger_random_exponent = 0;

// setup TiGer
config.tiger_block[0].enable = 1;
config.tiger_block[0].start = 0;
config.tiger_block[0].stop = config.tiger_block[0].start + 2;
config.tiger_block[0].negate = 0;
config.tiger_block[0].enable_lemo_output = 1;
config.tiger_block[0].sources = TIMETAGGER4_TRIGGER_SOURCE_AUTO;

// if TiGer is used for triggering other channels with positive pulses
config.dc_offset[0] = TIMETAGGER4_DC_OFFSET_P_LVCMOS_18; 
\end{lstlisting}

	\subsubsection{TiGer Example: Generate Common-Start from Stops}
	A trigger event on any Stop channel is used to generate the next event on the Start channel. 
	The start value of the TiGer block should be set so that the pulse occurs after the last stop event of the group.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb]
config.tiger_block[0].enable = 1;
config.tiger_block[0].start = 32;
config.tiger_block[0].stop = config.tiger_block[0].start + 2;
config.tiger_block[0].negate = 0;
config.tiger_block[0].enable_lemo_output = 1;
// an event on any of the channels A - D starts 
config.tiger_block[0].sources = TIMETAGGER4_TRIGGER_SOURCE_A|TIMETAGGER4_TRIGGER_SOURCE_B|TIMETAGGER4_TRIGGER_SOURCE_C|TIMETAGGER4_TRIGGER_SOURCE_D;

// if TiGer is used for triggering with positive pulses
config.dc_offset[0] = TIMETAGGER4_DC_OFFSET_P_LVCMOS_18; 
\end{lstlisting}
	
	\section{Performing a firmware update}

		After installing the \deviceName\ device driver, a firmware update tool is available.
		 By choosing ``FirmwareGUI.exe'' a firmware update can be performed. 
		 After invoking the application a window as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Firmware} will appear. 
		 The tool can be used for updating the firmware and to create a backup of the on-board calibration data of the \deviceName\ unit. 
		 If several boards are present, the one which is going to be used can be selected in the upper left corner of the window. 
		 When pressing one of the ``Backup'' buttons a backup of the firmware or the calibration data will be created, respectively. 
		 In order to perform a firmware update, chose the ``.cronorom''-file to be used by pressing ``Browse''. 
		 The file contains the firmware data. By pressing ``Flash'' the firmware is written to the board. 
		 ``Verify'' can be used to compare the firmware data stored on the \deviceName\ to the one inside a file.
		 ``Flash All'' and ``Verify All'' perform the corresponding operation on all boards which are installed.\par

				\caption{\label{fig:Firmware}The firmware update and calibration data backup tool as provided with the \deviceName\ device driver.}
			\end{center}
		\end{figure*}

\textbf{Important note:} The new firmware will only be used by the board after a power cycle, i.e. after switching the PC (or Ndigo crate) off and back on. 
A simple reboot is not sufficient. Therefore the information shown in the upper half of the application window does not change right after flashing a new firmware.
